# stellaris-steel-mod
This mod is a collection of small changes for my friends and I to use. You can use them too if you like the changes. This mod should be compatible with most others, as it only adjusts some defines. The only weirdness that could come up is if we touch the same values. For full details on what is modified, you can view the mod contents on your local system or online at https://github.com/steelstiletto/stellaris-steel-mod

Mod contents include:
-- Leader Changes
Leader pool changes more often and has a lower maximum age. Scientists assisting research at a planet should now scale with level, and will scan debris faster. Governors for sectors gain slightly more experience per month

-- War Changes
Spaceports have increased navy scaling per level, from 6/7/8/9/10/11 to 5/7/9/11/13/15

-- AI Opinion Changes
Border friction has a bigger impact on AI opinion. Maximum trust increased by 50%. AI cares slightly more about threat, and opinion weighs more into threat assesment. Enabled option for AI to sometimes colonize valuable non-adjacent systems

-- Misc Changes
Max trade deal length increased to 50 years, cost to remove systems from sectors reduced to 15, and scaling for faction support adjusted to matter more at low happiness and less at high happiness
