# stellaris-steel-homeworld-mod
Simple mod that changes the default system initializer settings to have a size 25 homeworld, with the extra spots filled in with dangerous wildlife tile blockers. I made it for me, because I hated being stuck with a size 16 core planet. It's probably OP, but at least it effects the AI too. Also lowers the variance of the two ideal nearby planets, from 12-18 and 14-24 to 15-18 and 18-23. Only the default empire initializer files are touched, so this should be compatible with anything that does not affect the default system generation. Works with the default Random, Sol, or Deneb system choices.
