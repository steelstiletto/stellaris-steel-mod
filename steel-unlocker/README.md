# stellaris-steel-homeworld-mod
Simple mod that changes the random system initializer settings to have a size 25 homeworld, with the extra spots filled in with dangerous wildlife tile blockers. I made it for me, because I hated being stuck with a size 16 core planet. It's probably OP, but at least it effects the AI too. Also lowers the variance of the two ideal nearby planets, from 12-18 and 14-24 to 15-18 and 18-23. Only the empire initializers file is touched, so this should be compatible with anything that does not affect the random starting systems initializer.
